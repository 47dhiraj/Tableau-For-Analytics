    Dimensions and Measures are two types of columns that have different roles in data analysis and visualization.


    ==> Dimensions: 

        Dimensions are categorical columns that generally contain qualitative data such as text, dates, and geographical locations. 
        
        They are used to segment/divide and categorize data into meaningful groups for analysis. 


    ==> Measures:

        Measures on the other hand, are quantitative columns that contain numerical data such as sales figures, quantities, and percentages.
        
        They are used to perform calculations and aggregate data into meaningful metrics for analysis.
