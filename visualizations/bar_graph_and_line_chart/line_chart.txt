Step-by-step guide to creating a line chart visualization in Tableau:


    1. Open Tableau and connect to your data source.

    2. Drag the dimension or field you want to visualize to the Columns shelf. 
        This will create the horizontal axis for your line chart.

    3. Drag the measure or field you want to visualize to the Rows shelf.

    4. Tableau will automatically create a line chart based on the fields you have selected. 
        You can customize the appearance of the chart by selecting different chart types, adjusting the color and size of the lines, and adding labels or annotations.

    5. To customize your line chart, select the chart and then use the Marks card to make changes. 
        For example, you can change the color or thickness of the lines, add labels or tooltips, or adjust the size of the points.

    6. You can also add additional dimensions or measures to the chart by dragging them to the appropriate shelves. 
        This will create additional lines in the chart.

    7. To add filters or other elements to your line chart, use the various options in the sidebar to customize your view.

    8. Once you are satisfied with your line chart, you can save it as a worksheet or add it to a dashboard to share with others.


    Wallah !
