# What is Conditional Formatting in Tableau ??


    ==> Tableau conditional formatting is a feature that allows users to apply  visual formatting, such as color, size, or shape, to data based on specific conditions or rules. 
        This means you can dynamically change the appearance of data points as they move through a chart or visualize numeric values depending upon other variable criteria.
    

    ==> This helps users identify trends, outliers, and patterns in the data more easily.


    ==> For example, suppose you have a dataset of sales data for different products across various regions. 
        You may want to highlight the top-performing products and regions by using conditional formatting.



# How to apply conditional formatting ?
