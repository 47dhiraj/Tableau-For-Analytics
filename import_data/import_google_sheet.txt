    Sure, here are the steps to directly connect to a Google Sheet in Google Drive from Tableau:

    2. In the "Connect" window, Click on "More" and now slect/click on "Google Drive" option.

        Alternative way: (If u have already previously connected to other google sheet on google drive) then,
            ==> In the "Connect" window, click on "Google Drive " / "Google Sheets", just under "To a Server" section.

    3. Now, "Sign In with Google" in browser will appear, so, Sign in to that Google account where the google sheet is located.

    4. A "Tableau wants to access your Google Account" message will appear on browser screen, click on "Allow" option.

    5. Find the Google Sheet you want to connect to inside of your google drive and simply click on below green "Connect" button.
        Alternative / Optional : If the sheet is not public, you will need to sign in to your Google account again and grant Tableau permission to access the sheet.

    7. Tableau will load the data from your Google Sheet. 
        And, now u should be able to preview the data of google sheet.

    8. Tableau will create a new worksheet with the imported data. 
        You can now start analyzing the data and creating visualizations.
