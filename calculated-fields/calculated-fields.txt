Calculated fields in Tableau are user-defined formulas that are created to perform complex calculations on the data in a visualization. 

They allow users to create new measures and dimensions by using functions, operators, and fields from the data source.


# Step-by-step guide to create a calculated field in tableau:

    1. Open a Tableau workbook and connect to your data source.

    2. Drag the relevant data source to the canvas and select the sheet you want to work on.

    3. In the Data pane, locate the field that you want to use to create the calculated field. 
        Right-click on the field and select "Calculated Field..." from the "Create" dropdown menu. 

    4. The Calculated Field editor dialog box will open. 
        Give your calculated field a name in the "Name" field at the top of the dialog box.

    5. In the "Formula" box, enter the formula for your calculated field. 
        You can use operators, functions, and other fields in the formula. 
        Tableau will offer suggestions as you type, and you can select the desired function or field from the dropdown menu.

    6. Once you have entered the formula, click on the "OK" button to save the calculated field.

    7. The new calculated field will now appear in the data pane under "Measures" or "Dimensions", depending on the type of field you created. 
        You can drag the calculated field to the canvas to use it in your visualization.

    8. You can edit the calculated field at any time by right-clicking on it in the data pane and selecting "Edit" from the menu. You can also delete the calculated field by selecting "Delete" from the same menu.
